$ mkdir hello-world

To go into that folder:
$ cd hello-world

To create a new Git instance for a project:
$ git init

That's it! It will just return you to a new line. If you want to be double-sure that it's a Git repository, type git status and if it doesn't return 'fatal: Not a git repository...', you're golden!
